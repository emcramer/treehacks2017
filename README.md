# Grain of Salt

## Introduction

In a time where media content is readily available, it is imperative that we maintain awareness about the diversity of opinions that we expose ourselves to. It is often too easy to expose ourselves to the same opinions and place ourselves in an echo chamber. Doing so reduces our ability for critical discussion, especially with those who don't think the way that we do.

Grain of Salt is an attempt to assist others in maintaining this awareness. The app is a Chrome plug-in that scans news articles to determine their political bias. It is designed solely in Javascript, and uses a Native Bayes Classifier to designate an article as "Liberal" or "Conservative".

## Native Bayes Classifier
A Native Bayes Classifier is a classification Machine learning problem. Given a feature set of vectors $x$, it computes the probability of the instance belonging to a particular class (out of a set of two or more classes) by applying Bayes' theorem, and then assigns the instance to the class with the highest probability.
